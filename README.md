NBA 2010 Dataset Data Visualization Project

This project uses the NBA 2010 dataset to explore and visualize various aspects of player performance and team statistics. By employing different data visualization techniques, we aim to uncover insights into player efficiency, team dynamics, and overall league trends.

Overview

The NBA 2010 dataset includes comprehensive statistics for players and teams during the 2010 season. This project focuses on:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Investigating data distributions, correlations, and trends.
Data Visualization: Creating various plots to visualize player and team performance metrics.
Methodology

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, normalizing statistics, and categorizing players by position and teams.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Using summary statistics and correlation analysis to identify key relationships in the data.
Visualization Techniques: Employing scatter plots, bar charts, heatmaps, and interactive visualizations using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.
Key Visualizations

Scatter Plot: Visualizing the relationship between player points per game and assists per game.
Bar Charts: Comparing team total points and wins.
Interactive Visualizations: Using Plotly to create dynamic charts for in-depth data exploration.
Findings

The visualizations provide insights into how different player statistics correlate with team success, highlight standout players, and reveal overall trends in player performance across the league.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates the value of data visualization in understanding complex datasets like those of NBA player and team statistics. Visual insights can help coaches, analysts, and fans to better understand the factors contributing to team success and player performance.
